# The Hall

This is my attempt to port the backend of [Artur Adip](http://github.com/arturadip)'s demo app "The Wall" to [Haskell](http://haskell.org) using the [Snap](http://snapframework.com) webapp framework.

The Wall is an [Agility.js](http://agilityjs.com) example app.  It lets you write on a virtual wall, anonymously. It uses MongoDB as the data store.

## Getting started




## TODO

 * fix bug by json encoding msg bodies (now a newline breaks the query)
 * implement delete method
